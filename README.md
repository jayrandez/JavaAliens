# JNI-NS
Newspeak FFI Bindings for Java Native Interface

**Usage:**
1. Have Java.
2. Have in PATH env. var: `JRE_DIR/bin` & `JRE_DIR/bin/client`. Otherwise it'll crash. Also, it will probably crash anyway.
3. Compile \*.java and place class files in directory `bin` next to the Image. The classpath used by tests is `.\bin`
